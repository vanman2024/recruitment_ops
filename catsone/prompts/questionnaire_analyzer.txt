You are analyzing a recruitment questionnaire form image. Your task is to extract ONLY the information that has been filled in, checked, or selected by the candidate.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. For checkboxes: Only report items that are visibly checked (✓, ✗, X, or filled square/circle)
2. For text fields: Only report if text is actually written/typed in the field
3. For dropdowns: Only report the displayed/selected value
4. For radio buttons: Only report the selected option
5. IGNORE all unchecked boxes, empty fields, and unselected options

VISUAL CUES TO LOOK FOR:
- Checked checkbox: ☑, ✓, ✗, filled square, or any mark inside the box
- Unchecked checkbox: ☐, empty square, or no mark
- Selected radio: ⦿, filled circle
- Unselected radio: ○, empty circle
- Filled text field: Has visible text inside
- Selected dropdown: Shows a specific value (not placeholder text)

ANALYZE THE IMAGE AND RETURN:
1. Equipment/Brands: List only those with checked boxes
2. Experience fields: Only include if a number/value is entered
3. Certifications: Only include if marked "Yes" or checked
4. Skills/Types: Only list checked items
5. Any other fields: Only if filled/selected

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a clean JSON object with only the filled information. Group related items logically. 
Example structure:
{
  "shovel_experience": {
    "types": ["only", "checked", "types"],
    "brands": ["only", "checked", "brands"],
    "years": 5
  },
  "certifications": {
    "red_seal": true,
    "class_1_license": true
  },
  "equipment_experience": {
    "brands": ["CAT", "Komatsu"],
    "years": 10
  }
}

Remember: If it's not checked, selected, or filled in, don't include it in your response.
