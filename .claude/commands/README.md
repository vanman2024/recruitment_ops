## Command Chaining

Commands are designed to flow into each other:
- Context commands â†’ Issue commands
- Issue commands â†’ Dev commands  
- Dev commands â†’ Test commands
- Test commands â†’ PR commands
- PR commands â†’ Deploy commands

Each command provides "Next Steps" suggestions for natural workflow progression.
