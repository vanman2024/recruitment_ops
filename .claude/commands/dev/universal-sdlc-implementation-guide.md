# Universal SDLC Implementation Guide

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for implementing the universal SDLC system that adapts to any project type while integrating with the three-tier AI architecture and multi-agent orchestration.

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Week 1)

### Step 1: Deploy Universal Project Detection
1. **Install the detection system:**
   ```bash
   # Copy universal detection functions
   cp .claude/commands/dev/universal-project-detection.md .claude/commands/dev/
   
   # Test detection on current project
   cd /home/gotime2022/devloop3
   source <(grep -A 100 "detect_project_language()" .claude/commands/dev/universal-project-detection.md)
   echo "Language: $(detect_project_language)"
   echo "Framework: $(detect_framework)"
   echo "Organization: $(get_default_organization)"
   ```

2. **Validate detection accuracy:**
   ```bash
   # Test on multiple project types
   cd /path/to/javascript/project && echo "JS: $(detect_project_language)"
   cd /path/to/python/project && echo "Python: $(detect_project_language)"
   cd /path/to/go/project && echo "Go: $(detect_project_language)"
   ```

### Step 2: Deploy Universal SDLC Command
1. **Replace existing SDLC command:**
   ```bash
   # Backup current SDLC
   cp .claude/commands/dev/sdlc-workflow.md .claude/commands/dev/sdlc-workflow-backup.md
   
   # Deploy universal SDLC
   cp .claude/commands/dev/universal-sdlc-workflow.md .claude/commands/dev/sdlc-workflow.md
   ```

2. **Test basic functionality:**
   ```bash
   # Test new feature creation
   /sdlc-workflow
   # Select: "new feature"
   # Enter: "Test universal SDLC"
   # Verify: Detection works and workflow starts
   ```

### Step 3: Validate Backward Compatibility
1. **Test with existing DevLoop3 project:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/gotime2022/devloop3
   /sdlc-workflow
   # Verify: All existing functionality works
   # Verify: Templates are discovered correctly
   # Verify: Test commands are detected properly
   ```

## Phase 2: Multi-Agent Integration (Week 2)

### Step 1: Deploy Agent Workflow Patterns
1. **Install pattern system:**
   ```bash
   cp .claude/commands/dev/agent-workflow-patterns.md .claude/commands/dev/
   ```

2. **Configure agent access:**
   ```bash
   # Update .claude/settings.local.json to include agent patterns
   jq '.allowed_tools += ["@agent-workflow-patterns.md"]' .claude/settings.local.json > temp.json
   mv temp.json .claude/settings.local.json
   ```

### Step 2: Deploy Multi-Agent Integration
1. **Install integration system:**
   ```bash
   cp .claude/commands/dev/multi-agent-integration.md .claude/commands/dev/
   ```

2. **Configure agent detection:**
   ```bash
   # Test agent capability detection
   source <(grep -A 50 "detectCapabilities" .claude/commands/dev/multi-agent-integration.md)
   ```

### Step 3: Test Agent Modes
1. **Single-Agent Mode (Current):**
   ```bash
   # Should work exactly as before
   /sdlc-workflow
   # Verify: Claude Code handles all tasks
   # Verify: Sub-agents are created as needed
   ```

2. **Multi-Agent Mode (Future):**
   ```bash
   # When Gemini and AI SDK are available
   # Verify: Gemini handles planning
   # Verify: Specialized agents coordinate
   # Verify: Claude Code handles development
   ```

## Phase 3: Organization Support (Week 3)

### Step 1: Test Multi-Organization Support
1. **Test with different organizations:**
   ```bash
   # Create test repositories in different orgs
   cd /tmp
   git clone https://github.com/testorg1/test-repo
   cd test-repo
   /sdlc-workflow
   # Verify: Detects testorg1 correctly
   
   cd /tmp
   git clone https://github.com/testorg2/test-repo
   cd test-repo
   /sdlc-workflow
   # Verify: Detects testorg2 correctly
   ```

### Step 2: Validate Project Type Support
1. **Test with different project types:**
   ```bash
   # JavaScript/React project
   npx create-react-app test-react
   cd test-react
   /sdlc-workflow
   # Verify: Detects React, Jest, npm scripts
   
   # Python/Django project
   django-admin startproject test-django
   cd test-django
   /sdlc-workflow
   # Verify: Detects Django, pytest patterns
   
   # Go project
   go mod init test-go
   /sdlc-workflow
   # Verify: Detects Go, go test patterns
   ```

## Phase 4: Production Validation (Week 4)

### Step 1: End-to-End Testing
1. **Complete workflow test:**
   ```bash
   # Create new feature using universal SDLC
   cd /home/gotime2022/devloop3
   /sdlc-workflow
   # Select: "new feature"
   # Enter: "Universal SDLC validation test"
   # Let it run completely
   # Verify: All steps complete successfully
   ```

2. **Multi-project validation:**
   ```bash
   # Test with external project
   cd /path/to/external/project
   /sdlc-workflow
   # Verify: Adapts to external project
   # Verify: Uses correct tools and patterns
   ```

### Step 2: Performance Testing
1. **Measure execution time:**
   ```bash
   # Time the workflow execution
   time /sdlc-workflow
   # Compare with original SDLC performance
   # Verify: No significant performance degradation
   ```

2. **Resource usage testing:**
   ```bash
   # Monitor resource usage during execution
   # Verify: Memory and CPU usage acceptable
   # Verify: No resource leaks
   ```
